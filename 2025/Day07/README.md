## Short summary

We are given a map. `S` is the starting point of the beam which points downwards. `.` is an empty space, just lets the beam move on. `^` is a splitter, which splits and moves the beam to the sides.

### Example

```
.......S.......

```

### Part 1

Count how many times the beam gets split. 1 splitter should only count once even if the beam gets there multiple times.
In other words how many splitters are in the way of the beam.

### Part 2

Count how many different path the beam takes until reaches the bottom.
