Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! 🎄✨

> Advent of Code is an annual programming event that runs every December. It offers a series of daily challenges with increasing difficulty, designed to improve problem-solving and coding skills. Each challenge is divided into two parts, and by solving them you earn stars ⭐.

Here are my solutions for the following years:

| Year				| Language	| Stars	 |
|-------------------|:---------:|:------:|
| [2024](./2024/)	| Python	| 46 ⭐	|
| [2023](./2023/)	| Python	| 31 ⭐	|
| [2021](./2021/)	| Python	| 20 ⭐	|
